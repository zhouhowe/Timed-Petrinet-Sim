# Example 2: Three Resources (Controlled)
# Input 1: Incidence Matrix, D
# No. of rows = No. of places = 18 		in the order:  p01, p02, p11, p12, p13, p14, p15, p21, p22, p23, p24, p25, rA, rB, rC, pC1, pC2, pC3
# No. of columns = No. of transitions = 12	in the natural order: left subnet first, then right subnet; from top to down in each subnet
